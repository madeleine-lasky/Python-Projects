# Turtle Crossing the Road Game 
This project utilizes the turtle module to create a Turtle crossing the road game. 
Currently I am independently studying python on the Udemy course, Angela Wu's 100 days of code. 
This project incorporates my code from her capstone project guidelines of the Turtle Crossing Game. Additionally, I decided to add a home screen in order to welcome the user which promotes client interactivity.
