# Python-Projects
Projects which explore the facets of Python including OOP, data structures and algorithms as well as different modules such as Pandas. Currently I am independently studying python through the Udemy course Angela Wu's 
100 days of code. In addition to independent projects, I will also be posting my code solutions to her prompts
and capstone projects.
