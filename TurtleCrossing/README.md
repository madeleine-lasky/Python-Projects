# Turtle Crossing the Road Game 
This project utilizes the turtle module to create a Turtle crossing the road game. 
Currently I am independently studying python on the Udemy course, Angela Wu's 100 days of code. 
This project incorporates her Turtle Crossing game, however, I decided to further the game by allowing a home
screen as well as multiple levels to the game.
